## 💎 Why this Showcase?

Traditional e-commerce is flat. This app brings **depth** and **emotion** to digital retail through:

*   🚀 **Orbital Floating Animations**: Products move in a natural, multi-axis orbital path, giving them a physical, high-end feel.
*   🌊 **Liquid Swipe Interaction**: Navigating between products feels fluid and elastic, mimicking the flow of water.
*   🌑 **Premium Dark Aesthetic**: A curated "Jet Black" theme with vibrant, shoe-specific glowing shadows and radial gradients.
*   ✨ **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern "Add to Cart" interactions using background blur and subtle lighting effects.
*   📡 **Live Feedback**: Real-time cart updates with elastic scale animations for immediate user satisfaction.
